The fiction network is an aggregate form, what one might call a macro-form. It is a fictional text – a representation of a fictional space – that is composed of the large-scale conglomeration of other texts. These networks are: proprietary – held as intellectual property by an owning body, and produced under the distinct context of modern capitalist media, rather than by a “folk culture” or a solitary author; persistent – maintained over time without a designated point of closure, and temporally outside the limits of any given artifact; expansive – constituted of a large number of artifacts, to a point where scale itself is a formative pressure; and, connected – constituted by intertextual relationships between artifacts, which in sum constitute a fictional world.

n, “fiction networking” is shorthand for the commercial generation and maintenance of a persistent, large-scale intertext for the purpose of both expanding and deepening consumer engagement. The term should be understood as describing a context that results in textual behaviors, but not necessarily a marker of formal similarity. In other words, fiction networks arise from a similar media ecology, and share characteristics and consequent behaviors, but they have very different compositions and formal operations. This definition attempts to explore connections in popular fictions among textual structures, textual meanings, and the material and cultural apparatus (contexts of production and reception, economic contexts, and technologies) that inform both.

s. As we will see later, some of the most productive moments in fiction networking build on a large and mature base of discursive complexity: a persistent intertext, with a coherent and engaged affinity group engaged in its reception, can generate its own jargon and shorthand, engage in dialogue with itself, rely on a shared history too large to retell in exposition. (...) The comics universe, in contrast, is a breeding ground of discursive complexity.

ks. Homogeneous networks generate meaning in accordance with the constraints and potentials of their semiotic (or, in the case of games, simulative) foundations, while heterogeneous networks attempt to generate a unified system of meaning across different semiotic systems, with varying degrees of success. In other words, each form will reflect these pressures differently as appropriate to its form (or aggregate of forms). However, they all operate under like pressures, and display some analogous behaviors as a result of those pressures. “Fiction network” as a term attempts to track common behaviors that manifest themselves across these different proprietary, persistent, expansive, connected forms of fiction, in the hopes that the drawing of cautious analogies will help inform the ongoing development and study of each of them. “Fiction network” is a category that can illustrate the effects of ownership, persistence, dispersion, and large-scale intertextuality on a narrative or simulation: its progress, its fictionality, its generic composition. “Fiction network” is also a category that places focus on the agents that produce and receive it: corporations, producers for hire, readers, reception communities.

“Fiction network” as a type likewise arises from a belief that reception – to varying degrees, in all these particular systems – has an effect on the text that lies well beyond the interpretive: that it can effect moments of physical textual construction and change. However, I posit this with a particular optic toward social rather than only individual effects on the text. In fiction networks, not only readers or players but receptive communities hold a radical agency; their aggregate responses to a network can and do shape the network’s literal evolution.

It is an immense story constituted of disposable periodicals, a reading experience where a reader must construct a history not from primary materials, but from retellings, which are generated by a interpretive community that reflects not only the influences of a corporate media producer, but, significantly, the influence of the universe’s fandom. The scale and the ephemerality of such fiction networks lend a particular critical and representational weight to these interpretive communities, which are, due to the inception of Internet technologies, increasingly coherent, concrete, and embodied in documents and artifacts.

At the same time, a fiction network is not an uncomplicatedly communal form; it is a proprietary thing, presupposing a capitalist context and a concept of regulated intellectual property which circumscribes the textual system in question. This ontology of commerce and ownership – the fiction network’s dual status as public imaginary form and private property – casts it in opposition to our generally-held understandings of folklore or the creative products of folk culture.

” The space of the fiction network is one where such struggle, founded upon hierarchies of power marked by proprietorship, plays out in the space of an ongoing narrative or simulation. The fiction network is, by definition, owned. Its audience understands its reception of the network as a transaction, and even its fans – who invest in the network as a site of recombination and creation, who contribute to the persistent text in their own varied ways – understand their relationship to the network as fraught and “second-class.” But this does not obviate their investment in the fiction, nor does it remove their formative impact on the fiction as it progresses. In this system, meaning is made in two spheres: that of fiction (a linguistic sphere) and that of branding (a sphere of consumption). These networks bear the compositional pressures of a dual identity: they are both fictions, or symbolic systems that present an imaginary space, and branded properties:

. The artifact (comic book, video game, movie) is, at once, both a branded consumer good and an utterance, laden with both nonlinguistic, culturally stable meanings and with the individual potential of a linguistic act. Further, the fictional world represented by this artifact must both, as a brand, present a conservative “object-code” of stable cultural meanings and, as a fiction, allow for a fluidity of meaning natural to a linguistically-constructed space, especially a game, where textual generation rather than representation is the driving operation. Finally, the world is both a fictional world that the reader/viewer/player observes and a culturally constituted world in a system of consumption. The consumer within a fiction network understands both an imaginary space, or fiction, and a cultural space of distinction which he or she chooses to appropriate. Though, again, this dual state of engagement is, arguably, at play with any text accessed in a capitalist context, it is amplified by the fiction network’s nature of persistence; as a consumer chooses to engage with the network not only with a discrete single purchase but as an ongoing investment, the network takes on an increasing meaning as a mark of identity distinction for a consumer within a material culture. One cannot easily assign predominance to one or the other level of meaning in the fiction network: it is as much an agent of material culture as it is an agent of fiction. Likewise, this duality does not only affect the artifacts of the network contextually or externally; this duality is formative, and is indicated within the text itself. The fiction network bears in its text a fundamental conflict between the conservative meanings of a brand and the fluid meanings of a text; it likewise presents itself, on the level of the text itself, both as a fiction and as a culturally constituted world the consumer can appropriate. This fundamentally distinguishes an artifact in a fiction network: it presents its conventional “object-code” as a brand, and its artistic operation as a creative work, in a state of dialectic that does not resolve. This dialectic is visible in the composition of artifacts. Again, this particular duality – network as fiction and network as space of consumer engagement at once – also owes much to the network’s formative property of persistence.
