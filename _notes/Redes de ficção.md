O conceito de Redes de ficção (fiction networks), cunhado por Jason Craft, descreve um texto ficcional - representação de um espaço ficcional - composto pelo aglomerado em larga escala de outros textos. 

A rede de ficção é produto das franquias de entretenimento, sendo intertextual e multimidiática por natureza. Elas são: proprietárias, persistentes, expansivas e interconectadas (características detalhadas mais adiante). Seu maior objetivo é expandir e aprofundar o engajamento de consumidores - por isso, podem ser descritas como um contexto que produz comportamentos de consumo. Assim, os textos que a constituem podem ser heterogêneos e mesmo não-narrativos, mas fazem parte da mesma ecologia midiática. 

>“Fiction network” as a term attempts to track common behaviors that manifest themselves across these different proprietary, persistent, expansive, connected forms of fiction, in the hopes that the drawing of cautious analogies will help inform the ongoing development and study of each of them. “Fiction network” is a category that can illustrate the effects of ownership, persistence, dispersion, and large-scale intertextuality on a narrative or simulation: its progress, its fictionality, its generic composition. “Fiction network” is also a category that places focus on the agents that produce and receive it: corporations, producers for hire, readers, reception communities.

A complexidade das redes de ficção não se manifesta necessariamente no nível da narrativa de um artefato (unidade). Ela emerge das relações construídas pelo intertexto persistente e leituras produtivas de um grupo receptivo coerente e engajado. Como é característica da narrativa seriada, o papel dos fãs vai além da interpretação, afetando os rumos da construção textual como agentes ativos no sistema de produção (ver [[Complexidade (Morin)]]). Comunidades receptoras tem "agência radical", à medida em que sua resposta pode moldar a evolução do ecossistema narrativo.

Ecoando a ideia de [[Heterarquias]]:

>It is an immense story constituted of disposable periodicals, a reading experience where a reader must construct a history not from primary materials, but from retellings, which are generated by a interpretive community that reflects not only the influences of a corporate media producer, but, significantly, the influence of the universe’s fandom. The scale and the ephemerality of such fiction networks lend a particular critical and representational weight to these interpretive communities, which are, due to the inception of Internet technologies, increasingly coherent, concrete, and embodied in documents and artifacts.

## Características das redes de ficção
**Propriedade

Redes de ficção são proprietárias, pressupondo um contexto capitalista e um conceito de propriedade intelectual que circunscreve o sistema textual em questão. No caso dos multiversos, isso estabelece fronteiras clara entre o que seria "canônico" e as produções de fãs e demais representações não-oficiais dos universos ficcionais. 

A audiência entende a recepção da rede como uma transação e mesmo os fãs (que investem na rede como espaço de recombinação e criação e contribuem para sua persistência) compreendem que tem uma relação instável com os produtores. A ontologia de comércio e IP empresta à rede um caráter duplo como forma de imaginário público e propriedade privada, ou, em outros termos, a rede é ao mesmo tempo ficção (um sistema simbólico que apresenta um universo imaginário) e identidade de marca, ou *brand.*

Neste contexto, os quadrinhos são ao mesmo tempo bem de consumo e elocução. Para Craft, o universo ficcional apresentado por este artefato deve apresentar, enquanto marca, um "código-objeto" de significados culturais estáveis e, enquanto ficção, a fluidez de sentido natural de um  espaço contruído linguisticamente.

>Finally, the world is both a fictional world that the reader/viewer/player observes and a culturally constituted world in a system of consumption. The consumer within a fiction network understands both an imaginary space, or fiction, and a cultural space of distinction which he or she chooses to appropriate. (...)  as a consumer chooses to engage with the network not only with a discrete single purchase but as an ongoing investment, the network takes on an increasing meaning as a mark of identity distinction for a consumer within a material culture. 

A dualidade observada pelo autor não afetaria o artefato ou a rede apenas contextualmente; ela é formativa, intrínseca ao próprio texto. O texto da rede de ficção carrega um conflito fundamental entre o sentido conservador da marca e a fluidez do texto, espelhando a dicotomia entre mito e romance observada no conceito de [[Tempo onírico (Eco)]]. Esta é uma dialética que não se resolve, uma vez que ela no centro da propriedade persistente de uma rede.

**Persistência

Um artefato (uma edição de quadrinhos, por exemplo) pode ser consumida por um período limitado de tempo, mas a rede de ficção perpassa este artefato e continua para além dele. Estas redes geram sentido a partir da ausência de final. Elas se desenrolam não em direção a uma conclusão, mas na continuação sem fechamento e - e, quando terminam, elas não costumam apresentar encerramento, mas exaustão.

Esta é uma característica da narrativa seriada que remonta aos primeiros folhetins e periódicos europeus. Embora o contexto produtivo tenha se transformado, o princípio das franquias multimidiáticas é o mesmo dos jornais do século XIX: um trabalho criativo contínuo mantém os clientes fiéis ao produto. Hoje, isso significa 


. Twenty-first century media corporations, with capital and resources exponentially greater than the largest Victorian press, produce the majority of our most popular fictions. For these corporations, an ongoing creative work – particularly one without a predetermined end – presents the best of all possible profit models: once it has established reader or viewer interest, it can capitalize on that interest indefinitely, through the sale of new, connected artifacts and spinoffs to that reader or viewer.

s. Media properties or icons, like mythical figures, have “immutable characteristics and an irreversible destiny” (Eco, "The Myth of Superman" 108) as branded properties; in a consumption culture, they carry stable meanings through their “object-code.” In modern capitalist culture, cultural meanings are maintained in different ways, but the cultural 42 icons are nonetheless analogous: these branded, constant icons have become nighmythological to us, familiar and ageless

Predictability and timelessness allow easy entry into the text and make the text appealing to new, unconverted audience members. However, the goal of the fiction network is not only to gain readers but to maintain their relationship with the network, and to do so effectively requires richer plots, tighter causality, engaging serial narrative.

**Expansão

A fiction network is distributed or expansive: it exists across multiple artifacts or “nodes.” 
. Even single-form networks rely on expansion: even outside of other media, the X-Men are presented in almost a dozen monthly comics, and the massively multiplayer game as an enterprise generates new and continuing interest through the periodic packaging and selling of “expansions” that add whole realms, states of being, or modes of play to the preexisting game structure. As an aggregate form, a fiction network consists of texts, each of which composes a portion of the network. I call these atomic or isolatable portions of the network artifacts. Artifacts generally serve marketing purposes – they are units that can be packaged and sold – but, in many cases, artifacts can be produced outside of a commercial context.

There is “code” or shared convention for any of these properties: icons or narremes, key elements crucial to the establishment of a 45 recognizable fictional space, that remain constant from medium to medium. Often, this package of elements incorporates both the “object-code” of the network as brand and a limited set of narrative elements; an artifact can evoke the larger fiction network, however, solely with the inclusion of the “object-code” or brand itself. This allows a widespread range of artifacts – radically different media, radically different forms, radically different interpretations – to be incorporated within the larger network and joined by a brand.

These universes, like other fiction networks, arise when a fiction is deployed widely across artifacts, often to the point where the number of artifacts is no longer easily apprehended or quantified

**Conexão

A fiction network is connected: nodes in a fiction network possess both a degree of autonomy and a degree of interdependence or information-sharing with other “nodes.” Given the parameters of a fiction network, intertextual connection is perhaps inevitable. Persistent and ongoing threads of a fiction network, progressing in parallel, will, to varying degrees, bear intertextually upon one another.

Intertextuality in fiction networks follows a continuum of coherence. In the examples above, and at many points in multiple-media universes, the connecting references are indirect; these moments bear upon their respective texts, but the connection does not have a literal causality. However, in other fiction networks, this intertextuality does manifest itself literally, with narratives merging into one another at junction nodes

The intertextualities at play in fiction networks can have implications not only for the texts themselves but for their readers, as audiences become increasingly familiar and comfortable with iterations of fictions that both differ from and inform one another.

ne: Here the spectators must know many things: they must certainly know of the existence of another film (extratextual knowledge), but they must also know that both monsters were created by Rambaldi and that the directors of the two films are linked together for various reasons… they must, in short, have not only a knowledge of the texts but also a knowledge of the world, of circumstances external to the texts. (Eco, "Interpreting Serials" 89)

These fiction networks, I would argue, imply a third Model Reader in its text as well: a reader who understands not only the message of the text and its structural or rhetorical choices, but also the contexts and mechanisms of production that have generated the text, and, importantly, the constitutive effect of these contexts and mechanisms upon the text. T

Because of the countless permutations of persistence, expansion, and connection that could generate a fiction network, each one has an individual topology; because persistence, expansion and connection are ongoing phenomena in a fiction network, each topology is always in a state of flux. A fiction network must therefore continue to explain its own form; it must continually make its rules of engagement comprehensible to the reader, even as those rules change and innovate. The ongoing metanarrative of the network – the story of its shape, and of its rules for reading – is negotiated in the network itself, with an implied Model Reader who will engage with this negotiation. Thus, the fiction network contains not only multiple persistent story threads, but also contains, at textual, intertextual, and/or metatextual points within those threads, information about the shape and composition of the network itself

**Emergência e escala

The phenomena of persistence, expansion and connection, in all these networks, serve a purpose of profit; their primary goal is to maximize and deepen consumer engagement. In their convergence, though, they have generated something unintended and new: large-scale, complex and evolutionary textual forms.

A fiction network is not necessarily a form ab ovo. Often, a form begins displaying the behaviors of “fiction networking” as a phenomenon of scale. Emergence or complexity theory attempts to explain macrobehaviors that arise in large, distributed collections of independent entities: ant colonies, slime mold aggregations, or even cities.

When persistence and expansion take fictions out of the hands of one author, or even a dozen – when an aggregation of stories, serials, and adaptations is old enough, or large enough, to begin displaying sophisticated intertextuality, or a visible awareness and negotiation, embedded within itself, of its own shape and rules – it has undergone a phase transition and has changed from an aggregate of related texts into a network. No network topology is the same, and consequently this point of phase transition cannot necessarily be predicted; however, fiction networks display demonstrably different behaviors from other textual aggregations, and these behaviors make them what they are.

This distinction – that “fiction network” is a definition more behavioral or contextual – is useful when discussing the various examples of fiction networks in this study, which are 54 characterized as much by divergence as by commonality.

On the other hand, a comics universe, as we will see, is the very analog (as in non-digital) result of decades of periodical publishing, where the idea of creative and audience agency are complicated and circumscribed by corporate ownership and the concept of work-for-hire. However, both are, like multiple-media story franchises, examples of large-scale fictions where persistence, expansion, and connection have created organized systems characterized by the intertextual and metatextual negotiation and play of a fiction network.
